    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>
            1 pound peeled, deveined large raw shrimp, patted dry
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon kosher salt
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided 
        </li>
        <li>
            3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
        </li>
        <li>
            2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated, plus more for garnish
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup dry white wine
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup thinly sliced shallot
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Toss shrimp with salt and pepper in a large bowl until well combined. Heat a large high-sided skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil; heat until shimmering, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp in an even layer, and cook until opaque and pink, 3 to 4 minutes, flipping shrimp halfway through cooking time. Transfer shrimp to a large plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with remaining 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil in the same skillet; stir in cherry tomatoes, shallot, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are soft and shallot is translucent, about 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir spinach, basil, wine, lemon zest, and crushed red pepper into mixture in skillet; cook over medium, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of skillet, until wine mixture is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. Reduce heat to low, and add Parmesan cheese; cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is slightly thickened and simmering, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in lemon juice; add cooked shrimp along with any juices from plate. Garnish with additional basil and Parmesan cheese.
